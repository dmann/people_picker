Testing Duke Authentication Service framework

This system can be configured as a [Duke Authentication Service](https://github.com/Duke-Translational-Bioinformatics/duke-authentication-service)
[implementation](https://github.com/Duke-Translational-Bioinformatics/duke-authentication-oauth2-spec) for any web service that uses the Duke Authentication Service.
It is designed for testing situations. Testers can use this system to pick, or
create fake, 'user' accounts that they can then use to authenticate against the external
client.

This authentication service can be configured to work with external web services using
the same OAUTH2 specification described in the Duke Authentication Service. Consumers
are configured the same way in both systems.
